# Welcome

This area is for technical staff that have the ability to install Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, provision new virtual machines within VMware, etc. If you got here from my blog post, you should share the blog post with your technical staff so that they have background information on why I’ve created this tutorial.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (click here for a 30-day trial)
- VMware vSphere v7 (or higher)
- A Windows Server with Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (free) installed.

## Simple examples to get you started
Remember, this is meant to be a collection of simple examples discussing different scenarios you might find yourself in when deploying a Privileged Access Management platform.

In these examples we’re going to discuss interfacing Red Hat Ansible with Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and VMware to keep your MDT-hosted images patched with the latest updates from Microsoft.

Please don’t read this and assume these are the only use case for Red Hat Ansible or a good source for establishing best practices for managing images. 

## See mistakes/bugs in our examples?
If you notice an issue with our documentation, please let us know. We want to fix everything. Just raise an issue in Github, and we'll address it.
